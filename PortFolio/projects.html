                            <h3>Type Racer Game</h3>
                            <p>It was the kind of competitive game where you could set up individual rooms and
                                compete against other clients. WPM (words per minute) and real-time progress
                                will be displayed to the clients in the same room, and the result will be displayed.
                                To manage the clients, I was utilizing my own customized websocket handler and
                                HTTP server. Upon receiving the request from the client to join the room, a
                                websocket connection is made to the room. Anyone attempting to join the game
                                can then enter the room password and be added to the room. The game will begin
                                when all players push the ready button</p>

                            <h3>Library Management System</h3>
                            <p>The user can retrieve and see the available books, making this essentially a basic
                                library system. In this project, two different kinds of logins are used.(Admin and
                                User).
                                The administrator has the option to add new books to the database or delete
                                existing ones. However, the user can only read and retrieve all of the books that
                                are stored in the database.
                                The server is used to retrieve the request and send the response. A lot of servers
                                are available, but now I am using Tomcat Server for this project, where I can
                                retrieve the information entered by the user and process the information.</p>
